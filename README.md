Challenges faced/facing while implementation:
1.Not able to run User interface test.
-There is a use of safari as the webdriver, the test when executed take localhost url port different every time the test runs.(Possible solutions tried: Searched stackoverflow, watched youtube tutorials on how to use the web driver with safari. But couldn't find the right solution for it.)

2.Not able to implement proper user interface.
-Tried to use the controllers to handle the pages. But with the implementation of API and database, the project ran into errors. Tried to resolve errors with the online available solutions. But ran into different errors everytime. Trying to use the simpler not the ideal way as of now for the user interfcae. The project will have the ideal user interface code in next phase.(updating as much as possible without facing errors with every commits)

3.Not able to resolve merge errors properly.
-After the merging of the two individual working on the same project. It gave few conflict/ assembly reference error which gave issues for the other one. Had to modified the project again with changes. Created new pages and added more use into the project. Linking with api and database gave few errors which took time to resolve analysing the source of the problem.
